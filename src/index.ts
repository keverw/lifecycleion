/**
 * Lifecycleion is a collection of utility libraries.

 * Import from specific subpaths instead of the package root:
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // ✅ Correct - Import from subpaths
 * import { chunk } from "lifecycleion/arrays"
 * import { Logger } from "lifecycleion/logger"
 * import { sleep } from "lifecycleion/sleep"
 *
 * // ❌ Wrong - Don't import from package root
 * import { something } from "lifecycleion"
 * ```
 *
 * See the README for a complete list of available imports:
