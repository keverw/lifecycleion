* Write a actual package.json desc, keywords and readme file
* write a better readme, I plan to put stuff in docs folder, make sure everything is exported
* Probably best to just list all the files and make sure it's covered by both docs and exports. Temped to allow separate exports
* Make sure import statements are right... and somewhat considering isoslated seperate imports for each lib since this is a mega repo....
